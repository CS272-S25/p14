# CS472 Group Project

Hello! Welcome to our website.

Our website is a student productivity tracker designed to keep users organized, focused, and motivated. It will have seven HTML pages, including a dashboard that provides a summary of tasks and study statistics. Students can manage assignments, track study time using a built-in timer, set personal goals, utilize a calendar, and celebrate milestones such as maintaining a one-week study streak. The final page introduces our team and shares our story. Our goal is to make studying both structured and engaging, offering a centralized space where students can boost productivity while keeping the experience enjoyable.
